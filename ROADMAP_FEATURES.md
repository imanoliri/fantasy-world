| #  | Feature Name                              | Status      | Summary/Key Mechanics                                                                                         |
|----|-------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Citizen Specialization                    | Planned     | Citizens specialize by type; production scales with % of quartiers dedicated to each type.                    |
| 2  | Variable Fluctuations                     | Planned     | Fluctuating cost and production variables (trade costs, food rates) responding to time/events.                |
| 3  | Migration and Settlement                  | Planned     | Population dynamically moves between burgs based on prosperity, disaster, opportunity, war.                   |
| 4  | Natural Disasters                         | Planned     | Simulate floods, plagues, droughts, earthquakes—impacting population, trade, and production.                  |
| 5  | Political Borders and Customs             | Planned     | Tariffs, borders, and diplomacy regulate travel and trade between cities.                                     |
| 6  | Wars, Raids, and Diplomacy (Snowball/Cost)| Planned     | War outcomes by soldier ratio (snowball effect); mass attacks penalized by high costs of fielding armies.     |
| 7  | Transport & Economies of Scale            | Planned     | Distance/trade costs reduced by traded volume; rewards major routes/infrastructure/project connections.       |
| 8  | Player Roleplaying & Moving Characters    | Planned     | Players control characters with professions; can travel, trade, wage war, negotiate, and influence world.     |
| 9  | Seasonal Cycles & Weather System          | Planned     | Seasons/weather impact food, trade, population health, travel, and events.                                    |
| 10 | Resource Depletion/Regeneration           | Planned     | Overuse depletes resources (forests, ore, fish); recovery requires time and strategy.                         |
| 11 | Religion and Belief Systems               | Planned     | Religious groups drive diplomacy, culture, migration, conflict, and festivals.                                |
| 12 | Technological Progression                 | Planned     | Cities research/acquire technology, transforming production, commerce, or warfare.                            |
| 13 | Static/Limited AI Major Characters        | Planned     | Influential, mostly location-tied NPCs (e.g., ruler, merchant) with simple actions/events affecting world.    |
| 14 | Procedural Quests and Missions            | Planned     | Simulation creates quests/missions reflecting the world’s needs, problems, and events.                        |
| 15 | Reputation and Influence                  | Planned     | Cities, players, and NPCs accrue reputation; impacts diplomacy, trade, migration, quests.                     |
