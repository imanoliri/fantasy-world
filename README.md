# Fantasy World

This is a tool to create & play with fantasy worlds. It can be used for storytelling, writing, DnD and other games. Feel free to fork it and add a web app, games and anything you like. It's based on Azgaar's fantastic "https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/" and the world is extended from there.
